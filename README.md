***
We reproduced the paper "Certifying Some Distributional Robustness with Principled Adversarial Training" [SND17]. We will Ô¨Årstly introduce the background of the problem, the existing solutions and their drawbacks and then describe the approach proposed by the paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10571).

There is an implementation by the author original(https://github.com/duchi-lab/certifiable-distributional-robustness)
